### Favorite tool?

I love using Figma to collaborate and share with others! It's a really good tool for creating high fidelity mock ups and keeping all your files organized. Also, I know I will get flames for this, but I really love using Axure. In 2018, there is still no prototyping tool that comes close to their functions.

### Best lifehack?

Learned from a TEDtalk that 99% of us are probably tying our shoes the wrong way. After the initial loop, swing the swoop the other way (counter clockwise) for a stronger knot. I'm serious about this one, try it on your rounded laces too) 

Oh and a second one... Stir fry your cauliflower rice with egg and soy sauce. 

### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?

Most likely, would have went back to school for my MBA and went the business route. 

### Favorite place to visit?

I love to travel and all, but seriously nothing beats the smell of early morning grass on the golf course. 

### Favorite hotkey?

Depending what im using, CMND Space, CMND 3, CMND ' 

### Advice for ambitious designers?

Since designers are expected to answer on behalf of the user, sometimes we fall in to this trap where we feel like our opinion is that of the user. Learn to be comfortable with not having an answer, but always stay curious. This means talking to people... so if  you're not good at that, figure out a way to get better.

### Last book you read?

Inspired by Marty Cagan 

### Most effective productivity booster?

I like to do my mental "heavy lifting" like interaction, logic, competitve research in the AM, and the click, click, drag stuff in the afternoon. 

### What keeps you up at night?
